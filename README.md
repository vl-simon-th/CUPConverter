## Disclaimer
The code is quite poor as it is the first bigger project I wrote.
At the time of writing I didn't fully understand the concept of pointers, the heap or memory leaks, so if you would start to look for them you would find a lot of wrong practices.
Also a lot of other features are implemented in a minimalistic and not fail-safe way.
