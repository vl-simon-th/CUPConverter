# CUPConverter
This is a small programm to convert waypoint .cup files, mainly used in gliding for airports...
into the older LX .txt format, so they can be imported in LXe and used on the LX7000 (Only select USER in the States Tab).

CUPConverter is written using Qt. You can get Qt at (https://www.qt.io/)

## Disclaimer
The code is quite poor as it is the first bigger project I wrote.
At the time of writing I didn't fully understand the concept of pointers, the heap or memory leaks, so if you would start to look for them you would find a lot of wrong practices.
Also a lot of other features are implemented in a minimalistic and not fail-safe way.
